## About

This is an npm library to get data about brazilian cities, states, districts and more.

It's made entirely based on the IBGE's APIs which you can find here: https://servicodados.ibge.gov.br/api/docs/localidades.

I'm still working on it, so far I've implemented functions for every API related to cities ('munic√≠pios' at IBGE's site).

## Instalation

```shell
npm i brazil-geodata
```

or

```shell
yarn add brazil-geodata
```

## Usage

You can simply import the lib in your javascript code and start using it right away!

Right now, there's only one option to import, which is `cities`:

```js
import { cities } from "brazil-geodata";
```

```js
const saoPauloCities = cities.getCitiesByState("SP");
```

### Cities:

|       Function        |            Args           | Return Value |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|--------|
|    getCitiesByState   |`state` ("AM", "RS", "RJ"...). You can use multiple states by separating them in a single string using pipes ("AM\|RS\|RJ") | An array containing the `id`, `name` and `value` of each city (name and value are the same.)|
| getCitiesByMesoregion |`mesoregion` (3301, 3302..). The numbers are the IDs of the mesoregions defined by IBGE. You can use multiple mesoregions by separating them in a single string using pipes ("3301\|3302\|3303") | An array containing the `id`, `name` and `value` of each city (name and value are the same.) |
| getCitiesByMicroregion |`microregion` (33001, 33002..). The numbers are the IDs of the mesoregions defined by IBGE. You can use multiple microregions by separating them in a single string using pipes ("33001\|33002\|33003") | An array containing the `id`, `name` and `value` of each city (name and value are the same.) |
| getAllCities | None | An array containing the `id`, `name` and `value` of every brazilian city (name and value are the same.) |
| getCityData | `cityId` (3201209, 1600303...). The numbers are the IDs of the cities defined by IBGE. You can use multiple cities by separating them in a single string using pipes ("3201209\|1600303") | An array containing the `id`, `name` and `value` of the city (name and value are the same.) |
| getCitiesByImmediateRegion |`immediateRegion` (310055, 320005..). The numbers are the IDs of the immediate regions defined by IBGE. You can use multiple immediate regions by separating them in a single string using pipes ("310055\|320005") | An array containing the `id`, `name` and `value` of each city (name and value are the same.) |
| getCitiesByIntermediateRegion |`intermediateRegion` (5202, 5206..). The numbers are the IDs of the intermediate regions defined by IBGE. You can use multiple intermediate regions by separating them in a single string using pipes ("5202\|5206") | An array containing the `id`, `name` and `value` of each city (name and value are the same.) |
| getCitiesByMacroRegion |`macroRegion` (2, 3, 4..). The numbers are the IDs of the macro-regions defined by IBGE. You can use multiple macro-regions by separating them in a single string using pipes ("2\|3\|4") | An array containing the `id`, `name` and `value` of each city (name and value are the same.) |
